# PlantGame
A Processing "game" inspired by Conway's Game of Life

Poorly written and probably vastly overcomplicated in many areas this was written as a way for me to become more familiar with Processing and programming as a whole. I am always open to suggestions on how to improve the code to run better and be more readable than this mess of spaghetti!

What it does:
The Plant Game is a zero-player "game" in the vein of Conway's Game of Life. A grid of tiles are instantiated and among those a number of them are given the attributes of a "plant" which will attempt to grow and invade neighboring tiles. Each plant has a random color and attributes associated with it which give some plants the edge over others. Over time one species will dominate the entire field until only it remains and the simulation will reset with a new randomized seed.

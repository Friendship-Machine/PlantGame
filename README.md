# PlantGame
A Processing "game" inspired by Conway's Game of Life

Poorly written and probably vastly overcomplicated in many areas this was written as a way for me to become more familiar with Processing and programming as a whole. I am always open to suggestions on how to improve the code to run better and be more readable than this mess of spaghetti!
